**EDIT**: hehetest2 has been banned from Typeracer for 12 hours for cheating, use this script at your own risk!!

**EDIT 2**: [spongecattle](https://github.com/spongecattle) (Zayne) is now the new official dev for typecheat, go to [his fork](https://github.com/spongecattle/typecheat) for updates. I will not be updating this script anymore!
