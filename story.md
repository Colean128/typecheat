So we were a team of 3 people: LoganDark, Zayne, and The Game. LoganDark coded the typecheat script, Zayne cheered him on (and was generally awesome) and The Game did the captcha (To raise the limit enough for typecheat to score 256 wpm on the leaderboards!)

It did require some effort, some awesomeness, and some Zayne, but it worked.
